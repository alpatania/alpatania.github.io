Grading Notes
======
The course grade will depend equally on Homework and Final project (40% each). The rest (20%), will be assigned according to the student participation in the course - that includes coming to office hours, or attendance in class, or intervening during lectures - and the work done in class during the in-class quiz.  
For the first 3 weeks of class, the homework and in-class quiz will be assigned and I will give feedback on the work done, but irregardless if the proofs are correct or not, the student will be given full mark if they have tried hard enough. My hope is to build up the confidence of students in proving abstract mathematical statements.
