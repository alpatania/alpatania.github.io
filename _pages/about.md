<p style = "font-weight: 400;">I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Vermont and core faculty of the Vermont Complex Systems Institute and part of its Steering committee. As a computational topologist, my research develops mathematical frameworks that bridge pure mathematics with practical applications in neuroscience and complex systems.</p>
<p style = "font-weight: 400;">My work focuses on modeling and analyzing higher-order interactions in networksâ€”relationships that involve multiple entities simultaneously rather than simple pairwise connections. I have developed several mathematical modeling approaches including the simplicial configuration model for null hypothesis testing in complex networks, applications of the Mapper algorithm for topological simplification of gene co-expression data, and measures of "simpliciality" that quantify the structural properties of higher-order networks.</p>
<p style = "font-weight: 400;">My current research explores sheaf-theoretic frameworks that can characterize and quantify the distance between observed noisy data and underlying topological structures. This approach scope is to embed uncertainty directly into topological models rather than treating it as external noise, offering new ways to handle real-world data complexity.</p>

<p style = "font-weight: 400;">In neuroscience, I study how topological approaches can reveal relationships between gene expression and brain function. My work has shown how gene co-expression networks match known brain anatomy, particularly in the dopaminergic pathway. I developed models for the joint analysis of genomics and neuroimaging data to better understand Alzheimer's disease progression using topological features. I also apply these mathematical tools to social networks, developing sheaf-based models that capture hierarchical structure and coherence properties in complex social systems.</p>
<p style = "font-weight: 400;">I co-developed XGI, an open-source Python package for higher-order interaction networks, and contribute to understanding synchronization, dynamics, and collective behaviors in simplicial complexes and hypergraphs. My research program combines topological theory with computational tools to analyze complex biological and social phenomena where traditional approaches may not capture emergent collective behaviors.</p>


<!--Here are some of the projects I am focusing on right now:
- Developing new technique for joint analysis of genomics and neuroimaging data for transitional clinical research, joint work with Liana G. Apostolova, MD (part of the IMAGENE project);
- Analysing dMRI lifespan data, joint work with Olaf Sporns, Joshua Faskowitz @ Indiana University
- Developing a stochastic sampler for Directed Simplicial Complexes;
- Studying Mathematical models of community structures in relation to simplicial complexes;
- Topological Data Analysis on Health data (rna transcriptomes, quantitative semantic data, brain networks from fMRI, EEG, DTI).
