My research develops mathematical and computational frameworks to analyze complex systems where interactions involve multiple entities simultaneously. 
By combining topological data analysis, network science, and information theory, I tackle problems in neuroscience and complex systems where traditional 
pairwise approaches fall short.

## Higher-Order Networks & Topology

Complex systems often exhibit interactions that go beyond simple pairwise relationships. I develop mathematical tools to model and analyze these **higher-order interactions**â€”relationships involving three or more entities at once.

**Recent Work:**
- **Information Theory Meets Topology (2025)**: Bridging topological and information-theoretic frameworks to understand synergy in complex systems, revealing how higher-order structures encode emergent information
- **Spectral Synchronization (2025)**: Novel methods for cluster synchronization using graph Laplacian eigenvectors, advancing our understanding of collective dynamics
- **XGI Software (2023)**: Co-developed comprehensive Python package for higher-order network analysis, now widely used in the research community
- **Simplicial Configuration Model**: A null model for hypothesis testing in higher-order networks that preserves structural properties while randomizing connections
- **Dynamics on Simplicial Complexes**: Understanding synchronization and collective behaviors in systems with multi-way interactions

**Representative Publications:**
- [The Topology of Synergy](/publication/2025-topology-synergy) (2025) - **NEW**
- [Cluster Synchronization via Graph Laplacian](/publication/2025-cluster-sync) (2025) - **NEW**
- [Networks Beyond Pairwise Interactions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2020.05.004) (2020) - **Highly Cited Review**
- [Simplicial Configuration Model](/publication/2017-scm) (2017)
- [The Shape of Collaborations](/publication/2017-shape-collaborations) (2017)

## Topological Neuroscience & Alzheimer's Disease

I apply topological and machine learning methods to understand relationships between brain structure, gene expression, and disease progression. My work reveals how mathematical topology can capture biological organization and predict clinical outcomes.

**Recent Work:**
- **NIH R21 Grant**: Principal Investigator on "Integrative Predictive Modeling of Alzheimer's Disease"
- **Early Risk Stratification (2024)**: Published machine learning framework in *Alzheimer's & Dementia* for early disease prediction using multimodal imaging and genetics
- **Multimodal Integration**: Developed frameworks for joint analysis of amyloid PET imaging and genetic data to predict Alzheimer's progression and identify early-stage subtypes
- **Gene-Brain Topology Connection**: Demonstrated that gene co-expression networks recapitulate known brain anatomy, particularly in the dopaminergic pathway

**Representative Publications:**
- [Integrating Amyloid Imaging and Genetics](/publication/2024-alzheimers-integration) (2024) - *Alzheimer's & Dementia*
- [Topological Gene Networks Recapitulate Brain Anatomy](/publication/2019-mapper-AHBA) (2019)
- [Mapper for Gene Co-Expression](/publication/2017-mapper-EMG) (2017)
- [ECoG Analysis](/publication/2020-ecog) (2020)

## Sheaf Theory & Information in Complex Systems

Real-world data is inherently noisy and complex systems exhibit emergent synergistic behaviors. My most recent endavour is to develop **sheaf-theoretic and information-theoretic frameworks** that characterize uncertainty and higher-order information directly into mathematical models.

**Latest Developments:**
- **Topology-Information Bridge (2025)**: Connecting topological approaches with information theory to quantify synergy and emergence in complex systems
- **Uncertainty-Aware Methods**: Frameworks that embed data quality and confidence directly into topological features rather than treating uncertainty as external noise
- **Synergy Quantification**: Methods to measure how collective higher-order interactions generate information beyond what individual components can provide
- **Coherence in Social Systems**: Sheaf-based models capturing hierarchical structure and information flow in complex social networks

**Representative Publications:**
- [The Topology of Synergy](/publication/2025-topology-synergy) (2025) - **NEW**
- [Topology of Data](/publication/2017-topology-data) (2017)
- [Choice & Social Networks](/publication/2020-choice-net) (2020)
- [Nerve Complexes](/publication/2021-nerve) (2021)
