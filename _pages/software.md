## XGI: Comple**X** **G**roup **I**nteractions

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgi-org/xgi/main/logo/logo.svg" alt="XGI Logo" width="200"/>

A comprehensive Python package for the representation, manipulation, and analysis of complex systems with **higher-order interactions** (networks beyond pairwise connections). Co-developed with an international team of network scientists.

**Features:**
- Rich data structures optimized for higher-order networks with hypergraphs and simplicial complex representations
- Built-in dynamical models for: synchronization, contagion, opinion formation
- Network statistics and measures
- Visualization tools
- Integration with NetworkX ecosystem
